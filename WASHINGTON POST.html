        <h2>Local Redneck Storms the White House For Drive Through Liquor Stores</h2>
        <p>"Violence is a legitible form of expression! As an American, I got the right to express my opinions under the First Commandment!" shouted Cletus Fitzgerald McWilliams, a local man from the backwoods of Southtown, as he drove his 2016 GMC Terrain straight through the White House gates.</p>
        <article class="artc-section">
            <img src="redneck.png" alt="THERE IS SUPPOSED TO BE A FREDDY PIC HERE.">
            <p> The man, who was reportedly enraged by what he called the "liberal president's decision" to overturn his appeal for drive-through liquor and gun stores, left a trail of destruction in his wake, taking out multiple Secret Service agents who valiantly tried to stop him. McWilliams, 
                who was previously charged with <span class="highlight">indecent exposure </span> at a Chuck E. Cheese, is now facing 30 years to life in prison.

                Witnesses report he demanded to speak directly to the president, saying, "I need my Jack Daniels and my AR-15 in one go, and I won't take no for an answer!"
                
                Authorities say McWilliams is currently being held at <span class="highlight">Southtown Police Department Jail,</span> where his claims of innocence remain highly questionable.

                <p> A new online dating website, just launched last month, is under scrutiny for its faulty background checks after a murder occurred between two users: <span class="highlight">Nicholas Hopkins</span> and the now-deceased <span class="highlight">Anthony Corrado Jr.</span>

                    The suspected perpetrator, Nicholas Hopkins, had intriguingly described himself as "a vulnerable guy who needs to be held by big, strong arms," which police believe might have been a ploy to attract wealthy, older men for eventual robbery and murder.
                    
                    Authorities are currently on a city-wide manhunt for Nicholas, with several witnesses claiming to have spotted him at the "Honkers" Strip Club.

                <h2>Salieri DiLorenzo Appointed To Become An Acting President</h2>
                <p>"I know I never had a real job, but I still understand the economy better than you do. Probably because of my deep, meticilous voice," said Salieri DiLorenzo in a recent interview.</p>

                <article class="artc-section">
                    <img src="banner.png" alt="">
                    <p> In a bold new direction, America is embracing inclusion like never before. Under President Salieri, this means not only a significant tax overhaul but also a dramatic redesign of the American flag. DiLorenzo has unveiled a new flag design set to replace the current one on November 17th.
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="highlight">“It’s psychologically proven to resolve conflicts. The old flag was too aggressive—too many enemy combatants were offended by it,” Salieri explained. “This new flag symbolizes peace and encourages citizens to engage in the ongoing debates about gender identity and undocumented immigrant rights.”</span></p>
